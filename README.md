# CIS256 Student Grade Test

This is a basic Python repository holding a StudentGrade class demonstration program, the class itself, and

a unit testing program. Each additional file inherits all attributes and/or methods from the student\_grade

program file, and may be used for educational purposes. For more information, download the repository and

run the program(s) yourself.



This repository consists of:

* student\_grade.py (the class definition file itself)
* student\_grade\_demo.py (a testing program for the class with input)
* test\_student\_grade.py (a unit testing program for the class (no input))
* \_\_init\_\_.py (the package initializer file. Included to test package functionality)
